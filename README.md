# Computer Vision Studies

Files I've made while studying computer vision with the book "Introdução a Visão Computacional com Python e OpenCV 3"(English: "Introduction to Computer Vision with Python and OpenCV 3") by [Ricardo Antonelo](https://antonello.com.br/).

You can find the book [here](https://github.com/Ckk3/introducion-to-computer-vision/blob/a2bb9264d0c0276147bf402275bae10553c0260f/Livro-Introdu%C3%A7%C3%A3o-a-Vis%C3%A3o-Computacional-com-Python-e-OpenCV-3.pdf).
